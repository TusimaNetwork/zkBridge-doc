# Claim test tokens

Click the ‘Faucet’ button to claim test tokens for both the Goerli network and the zkSync Era Testnet network. After claiming, add the test tokens to Metamask. (Note: Claim Goerli tokens first, ‘Add’ to Metamask, then claim zkSync Testnet tokens and add them to Metamask; these are test tokens from two different chains.)

After claiming successfully, you can check in your wallet. You will have 1000 TSM, 1000 USDC, and 1000 USDT on both the Goerli network and zkSync Era Testnet network.

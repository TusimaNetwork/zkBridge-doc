# Cross-chain messaging

With Tusima zkBridge, you can send messages from any supported source chain that uses Ethereum consensus to any destination chain that can run the Tusima zkBridge light client. This arbitrary message passing is the basis for any kind of cross-chain application you may want to develop.

After selecting the source chain and destination chain, enter the message you want to send. Click the ‘Send’ button and confirm the transaction in Metamask.

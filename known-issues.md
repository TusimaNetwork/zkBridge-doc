# Known issues

Tusima zkBridge is currently in the testnet phase and the following are a few known issues:

1. Currently, the Messaging component is not yet subject to any charges, which means it is incomplete. We plan to introduce a paid version soon, which may affect the DApp you have already developed based on Messaging, making it temporarily unusable. Even though we are currently in the testing phase, we recommend that you prepare for this.
2. It's important to note that there are some stability issues on the Goerli Testnet at the moment. This can impact cross-chain transactions between Goerli and BSC Testnet, causing them to become slow in certain situations.

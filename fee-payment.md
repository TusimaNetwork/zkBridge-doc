# Fee Payment

Tusima zkBridge is committed to creating a permissionless bridge, where its off-chain nodes (Operator and Relayer) can be operated by anyone. However, running these nodes incurs costs, which include the expenses of cloud servers and transaction fees (Gas). All of these costs will be covered by the transaction fees for each cross-chain transaction.

Currently, Tusima zkBridge Messaging has not yet established charging rules and will implement them in the future. The following details are related to the Token Bridge fees.

The Token Bridge will charge a fee of five-thousandths of the transaction amount for each cross-chain transaction. Since the value of each token may vary, the fees will also differ, but will never be lower than $5.

Tusima zkBridge is a one-stop cross-chain solution based on zkSNARKs technology that is trustless and permissionless.

Tusima zkBridge endeavors to establish a trustless and permissionless cross-chain infrastructure that facilitates seamless and secure cross-chain communication. It empowers the streamlined development of comprehensive blockchain applications, including but not limited to omnichain tokens and cross-chain lending. Currently, it supports the following two cross-chain methods:

* Goerli -> BSC Testnet
* Goerli <-> zkSync era Testnet

Notice:

We are currently still in the testnet stage. We cannot guarantee that the product will be free from any defects. And there still are some known issues, you can see from [here](known-issues.md).

But anyway it wonâ€™t cause any damage to your property.

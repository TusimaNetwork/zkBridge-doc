description: Learn how to perform cross-chain messaging through Tusima zkBridge.

# Overview

With the help of `Messaging`, you can send messages from any source chain that supports Ethereum consensus to any destination chain capable of running the Tusima On-chain Light Client (currently implemented in EVM).

To send messages using `Messaging`, you need a sending contract on the source chain and a target contract on the target chain. We will provide detailed instructions on how to write both in the following sections.

The data included in cross-chain messages can be tailored to your needs and may include:

* Simple text messages
* Complex data structures
* Functions call

This versatile messaging method serves as the foundation for developing various types of cross-chain applications to suit your requirements.

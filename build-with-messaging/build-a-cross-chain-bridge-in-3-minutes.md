# Build a cross-chain bridge in 3 minutes

This article will guide you through a demo on how to achieve a quick cross-chain token transfer using Tusima zkBridge. This demo will involve three contracts: TokenMock.sol, TokenSender.sol, and TokenReceiver.sol. These contracts will utilize the cross-chain communication capabilities provided by Tusima zkBridge's Messaging component to transfer a token from one blockchain to another in a short amount of time.

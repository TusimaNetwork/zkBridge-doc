# Token Bridge

The **Token Bridge** is a cross-chain protocol designed for consumer (C-end) users, enabling the seamless transfer of assets across different blockchains. It leverages the cross-chain communication capabilities provided by the `Messaging` contract and extends this functionality to enable cross-chain transfers of `ERC20` tokens.
